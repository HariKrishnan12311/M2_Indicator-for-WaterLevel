# M2_Indicator-to-check-WaterLevel-in-tanks


A water level indicator is a system that relays information back to a control panel to indicate whether a body of water has a high or low water level. Some water level indicators use a combination of probe sensors or float switches to sense water levels. “The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.”
