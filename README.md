# M2_Indicator-to-check-WaterLevel-in-tanks


A water level indicator is a system that relays information back to a control panel to indicate whether a body of water has a high or low water level. Some water level indicators use a combination of probe sensors or float switches to sense water levels. ‚ÄúThe Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.‚Äù

In  this  automated  world,  the 
handling  of  any  kind  of  devices  with  comfort  is  made  to  be  the  easiest  factor  everywhere.  Considering  this  aspect 
of  comfort  zones  and  the  prevention  of  wastage  of  resources,  a  design  of  an  automated  overflow  control  circuit 
unit  was  proposed.  The  proposal  was  designed  on  the  perspective  of  controlling  the  flow  of  water 
into  the  tanks  automatically.Basically  automation  in  systems  would  help  reduce  wastage  of  resources  in  various  ways,  one  such  way  for  the 
prevention  of  wastage  of  water  resource  to  control  the  water  tanks  from  overflow.Some of the basic feautures are,
 
1.Shows water level <br />
2.cut off water automatically <br />
3.User friendly
